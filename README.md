# portfolio_project
This is the second Project from the Module-1 'The Portal' using HTML and CSS

The use of new design tools of different Figma Templates, specifically Microverse template number 1, helps programmers to increase their knowledge and field of work.

New css properties such as grid and flexbox were used, which were an essential implement for the organization of the project's sections.
